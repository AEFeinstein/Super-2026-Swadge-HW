# Super 2026 Swadge 3D Printing Assets

Introducing the WUB TANK, the newest addition to the Swadge shell collection

## Built With

* [Fusion 360]( https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) 
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org) 
* [Orcaslicer](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer?tab=readme-ov-file)

## Getting Started

The included files are STEP type so they can be modified to your liking, and most slicer programs will readily load them. The Wub-Tank-Proto.step is the final fit check model before art assets were added. Designed to be readily printable. Recommended settings: 0 top/bottom layers for exposed (honeycomb) infill effect when printed as is.

## Recommended Materials

PLA 
PETG
TPU

## Assembly

The WUB TANK Shell requires a single M3x8 screw.

## Secret 3D Upgrade Add-ons

In addition to the shell model, there are a number of 3D-printable accessories for the Swadge this year. There are STEP files for each, and customized Orcaslicer 3MF project files are also included as reference, or ready to print for the Prusa Core ONE. 

- Pulse-Visor: SPECIFIC FILAMENT REQUIRED. The Pulse Visor was designed to be printed with Cookiecad "Black Star Stuff PLA". Clear PLA or PETG should work as well. As long as the filament isn't to opaque, the lens region of the visor should be thin enough to see the LED's but they may be obscured. Install using thin double-sided tape. Try printing this with a holographic print bed. Enjoy!

- Corruption Crest: A friction fit add-on that attaches to the standard acrylic diffuser. It was designed to be one of several Megaman style powerups. I recommend printing this in purple filament.

- Crest Diffuser Template: A version of the corruption crest with all original art removed so you can design your own. GO NUTS! Just don't cut away the tabs that hold it on.

- M-Diffuser: WARNING ADVANCED!!! Designed as a substitute for the included acrylic diffuser, since the prototype did not include one. If you want to make one, you'll need some clear/translucent filament, double sided tape, and be gentle when removing the acrylic so as not to damage the PCB surface. For best results use a clear filament and 100% concentric infill for the bottom 3mm, and a translucent color for the remainder with the top layers turned off to expose the infill with your choice of infill pattern. Print the squarewave insert seperately (in neon green or glow in the dark filament). Optional... change filament partway through to make it extra fancy.
